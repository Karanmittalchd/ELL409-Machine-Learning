#ELL409: Machine Intelligence and Learning
1)Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network: 
- Implemented Backpropagation algorithm, without any external library, to train the neural network on MNIST
- Studied variation with hidden layers, neurons per layer, different activation functions, batch size, learning rate

2)Epsilon & RH Support Vector Regression:
- Formulated quadratic programs, implemented both the algorithms and solved them using CVXOPT framework
- Performed regression on Boston Housing dataset, analysed for different kernels, tuned various hyperparameters
